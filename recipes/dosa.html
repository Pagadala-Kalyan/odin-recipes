    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Dosa is a popular South Indian dish that is a thin, crispy pancake made from a fermented batter of rice and urad dal (split black gram). It's light, flavorful, and pairs wonderfully with chutneys, sambar, or even a simple potato filling (masala dosa). Itâ€™s a staple breakfast dish in many Indian households, often enjoyed with a cup of steaming hot filter coffee</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>

        <li>1/2 teaspoon fenugreek seeds (optional, helps in fermentation)</li>
        <li>Water (for soaking and grinding)</li>
        <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
